### Configuring Monthly Step Limit

You can change your monthly step limit in two ways:

1. **Through Windsurf Settings**
   - Open Windsurf Settings
   - Search for "windsurf-step-tracker"
   - Look for the "Monthly Limit" setting
   - Enter your desired step limit (default is 1000)

2. **Directly in step-tracker.json**
   - Navigate to `~/.windsurf/step-tracker.json`
   - Find the `monthly_limit` field
   - Update the value to your desired limit
   - Save the file

### Tracking Steps with Cascade AI

Important: You need to explicitly ask Cascade to track steps - it does not happen automatically! 

The step tracking data is stored in:
```
~/.windsurf/step-tracker.json
```

Here's how to track your steps:

1. **Request Step Tracking**
   - At the beginning of your conversation, tell Cascade: "Please track steps for this conversation"
   - Or at any point during/after the conversation: "Please add X steps to my tracker"
   - Make sure to request tracking for each conversation where you want to count steps

2. **View Current Stats**
   - Check the Step Tracker panel in the sidebar
   - Look directly at the `step-tracker.json` file in your home directory
   - Ask Cascade: "How many steps have I used so far?"

3. **Best Practices**
   - Always request step tracking at the start of important conversations
   - Monitor your usage regularly through the Step Tracker panel
   - Review the `step-tracker.json` file if you need detailed history
   - Keep track of your monthly limits to avoid interruptions

Remember: If you don't explicitly ask Cascade to track steps, they won't be recorded in your step count!

## Data Storage

The extension stores all step tracking data in the `.windsurf` directory in your home folder. The data persists between Windsurf sessions and is shared across different Windsurf windows.
